# Description

**A flock of fairies, managed by a schooling behaviour, is minding its own business when birds of prey using noise-wander behaviours descend upon them. They must use their size and maneuverabiltiy to evade the projectiles fired by these birds.**

A 'nature sim' in the sense that it simulates a school o fboids, which can be dispersed when attacked by a not strange bird of prey launching its own feathers. This stemmed from acombination of different inspirations, all amalgamating into this strange little implementation.
